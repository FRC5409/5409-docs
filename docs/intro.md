# FRC Team 5409 - The Chargers Programming Documentation

Welcome to The Chargers' comprehensive programming guide! This documentation covers our approach to programming FRC robots from scratch, including our methodologies, tools, and lessons learned over the years.

## What You'll Find Here

This documentation is organized into several key sections:

### [Robot Documentation](/docs/Robots/PastYears)
Detailed documentation for each of our robots, including hardware specs, software architecture, and development insights. Learn about our 2025 robot "Cobra" and our past robots.

### [Data Logging](/docs/Data%20Logging/DataLogging)
Everything you need to know about implementing AdvantageKit for comprehensive robot data logging. Understand the IO layer pattern, subsystem architecture, and debugging strategies.

### [Robot Simulation](/docs/Simulation/Intro)
Learn how to set up and use robot simulation for safe code development. Covers MapleSim integration, AdvantageScope visualization, and best practices for simulation-driven development.

## Getting Started

If you're new to FRC programming or joining our team, we recommend starting with:

1. **[WPILibs Docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html)** - Official programming docs
2. **[Robot Overview](/docs/Robots/PastYears)** - Understand our hardware and software choices
3. **[Data Logging Introduction](/docs/Data%20Logging/DataLogging)** - Learn our debugging methodology
4. **[Simulation Setup](/docs/Simulation/Intro)** - Set up your development environment
